How to view HTML source?
To find out, right-click in the page and select "View page Source"(in Chrome) or "view
Source" (in IE), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the 
HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML element:
right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "inspect" or "inspect Element"
to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can
also edit the HTML OR CSS on the fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.
